Computer vision - Text identification

The steps followed were followed:
(1)	Boundary Detection of templates “2.bmp” and “C.bmp”
(2)	Find Fourier Descriptors of boundaries on templates
(3)	Translation, Scale and Rotation Invariance
(4)	Remove High Frequency Components 
(5)	Boundary Detection & Fourier Descriptors for image “a4.bmp”
(6)	Template matching to “a4.bmp”.
(7)	Identify “2” and “C” on “a4.bmp”
