The steps followed were followed: \n
(1)	Boundary Detection of templates “2.bmp” and “C.bmp” \n
(2)	Find Fourier Descriptors of boundaries on templates \n
(3)	Translation, Scale and Rotation Invariance \n
(4)	Remove High Frequency Components \n
(5)	Boundary Detection & Fourier Descriptors for image “a4.bmp” \n
(6)	Template matching to “a4.bmp”. \n
(7)	Identify “2” and “C” on “a4.bmp” \n
